# LineTracker_Server_Robot
> ### Project developed in may/june 2021 for our finals in TI502

<p>This is a robot made in the [https://cyberbotics.com/](Webots IDE) and programmed in Python designed to have two functionalities:</p>

               The robot was programmed in order to follow the black path detected by 3 infrared sensors in front of the robot. It also can dodge obstacules that it finds <br>

  <li> <strong>Web Socket Server</strong>:<br>
               Besides that, our teacher also requested that the robot hosted a socket server that responded an HTTP request with the current image that the camera on top of<br>
               the robot took.
</ul>
